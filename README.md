## Hi, My name is Ezkahan ðŸ‘‹

Front-end developer with 4 years of experience in the IT industry. In addition, I constantly develop and follow new technologies, which allows me to create a high-quality and modern product. I am proficient at all things React and frontend development. I have experience with React SPA, as well as many supplemental UI libraries including MUI and Tailwind. Iâ€™m skilled on the data side of things too, with experience using Redux, React hooks and state management, and integration of APIs via full backends or headless services.
